        # Usually "ubuntu-latest" is the most recent LTS version of Ubuntu, but there can be a bit of lag between a new
        # LTS release and the update of ubuntu-latest (eg in October 2022, it was still Ubuntu 20.04 rather than 22.04).

      # See https://github.com/Brewtarget/brewtarget/wiki/Development:-Getting-Started for more on what is needed to build
      # the software.  Most of this is now automated in 'bt setup all'.
      #
      # Some of the things that the bt script installs could be installed via actions (eg jurplel/install-qt-action@v3)
      # and some are already installed by default for GitHub actions (eg cmake, git, debhelper, rpm) but there's an
      # advantage, where we can, in doing the exact same steps that give as instructions to developers to set up their
      # build environment.
      #
      # Of course, since 'bt' is a Python script, it can't install Python, so we need to do that first.  We need Python
      # 3.10 or newer, which means you can't just use `sudo apt install` on older Ubuntus.  (Eg Ubuntu 18.04 packages
      # have only Python 3.6.7 and Ubuntu 20.04 only have Python 3.8.2.  However Ubuntu 22.04 has Python 3.10.6.)  There
      # are ways to get around this, but, in this context, it's simplest to use a canned GitHub action.
