      # Installing Xalan-C will cause Xerces-C to be installed too (as the former depends on the latter)
      # .:TBD:. Installing Boost here doesn't seem to give us libboost_stacktrace_backtrace
      #         Also, trying to use the "--cc=clang" option to install boost gives an error ("Error: boost: no bottle
      #         available!")  For the moment, we're just using Boost header files on Mac though, so this should be OK.
      #
      # The `brew doctor` command just checks that Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) is installed OK (expected output is "Your
      # system is ready to brew".  Having Homebrew installed should imply the Xcode Command Line Tools are also
      # installed, but `xcode-select -p` confirms this (expected output "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools").  As
      # elsewhere we use the echo trick to ensure that a non-zero return value from these diagnostic commands is not
      # treated as a build script failure.
      #
      # We use the tree command for diagnosing certain build problems (specifically to see what changes certain parts of
      # the build have made to the build directory tree).  (If need be, you can also download the entire build directory
      # within a day of a failed build running, but you need a decent internet connection for this as it's quite large.)
