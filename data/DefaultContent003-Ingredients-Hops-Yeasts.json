Galaxy hops were developed by Hop Products Australia in the mid-1990s, but not released until 2009. \n\nGalaxy is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process.\n\nGalaxy hops have one of the highest concentrations of essential oils known in hops, which has contributed to its meteoric rise in popularity. Galaxy is often described as having a strong passion fruit aroma and flavor as well as blasts of citrus and peach. At times, you can also experience pineapple and tropical fruit hints. Galaxy hops are all fruit with little to no floral, pine, or spice characteristics.\n\nGalaxy hops are extremely versatile. They can work compliment other hops perfectly, or take center stage as the primary flavor. Their high alpha acid content make them especially suited to late boil and dry hopping. Their distinctive mixture of citrus, passion fruit, peach and hints of grass is sure to stand out and create a beer like no other.\n\nGalaxy hops are typically used in the following styles: Pale Ale, IPA, Barley Wine, Fruit Beers, Saison, Wheat Beers and Wild Ale."

This hop is most noted for its blueberry and tropical aromas, but is also known to have citrus, grassy, pine, spice, tangerine, papaya, rose, earthy, floral (blossoms), and bubble gum descriptors. \n\nThe aroma/flavor descriptors for the wildly popular Mosaic hop commonly include fruity (blueberry), citrus (tangerine, grapefruit), tropical (mango, guava), floral, and earthy. The combination of these aroma/flavor descriptors with the relatively high alpha-acid levels allows this hop to serve a dual purpose, as both a bittering and flavor/aroma hop in the brewing process. Ultimately, Mosaic provides flavor and aroma profiles in beer that simply cannot be accomplished with other hop cultivars.\n\nAs for growing properties of this hop, Mosaic has a tight-knit appearance with a compact cone. Mosaic has a unique aroma combined with high α-acid content, powdery mildew tolerance, and exceptional yield.\n\nMosaic hops are typically used in the following styles: American Pale Ale, IPA, Double IPA and Stout."

The fruitiness may be a little overpowering for the uninitiated, however those with a penchant for bold hop character will find several applications for this true brewer's hop.\n\nNelson Sauvin hops are typically used in the following styles: American Ale, Lager and IPA."

Released in 1995.\n\nTillicum is a bittering hop that is commonly used only to bitter the beer during brewing, and not for too much flavor and aromas.\n\nTillicum is a high alpha variety with a very high content of beta acids. The variety was developed through the John I. Haas, Inc. breeding program and released in 1995. It is a daughter of Galena and a full sister to Chelan and therefore has analytical data similar to both varieties."

For a yeast that's as dry as it is, it creates beers with a surprising amount of balance even without the use of specialty grains or adjuncts. While we haven't completed our own tests in house, this yeast is used at the brewery from which it was isolated to make big beers that are in the neighborhood of 12-16% ABV and sufficiently dry. Use Dry Belgian Ale as a primary fermenter in any big Belgian beer, or to unstick that pesky stuck fermentation. To achieve high attenuation, we recommend fermenting with this strain at 70-71 °F for the first 2-3 days, and then bumping up the temperature to 74-75 °F for the remainder of fermentation.",
