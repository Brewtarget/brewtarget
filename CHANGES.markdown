# Brewtarget Changelog

This change log is for high-level user-visible changes to Brewtarget, intended for consumption by the typical end-user.
Note however that we also process it into a Debian-compliant text change log, so we need to keep the format consistent.
In particular, the Release Timestamp section is needed as part of this (and you need to be meticulous about the date
format therein, otherwise you'll get, eg, no-changelogname-tag error from rpmlint).  You get problems if you set the
release timestamp to be a date in the future, and I'm guessing nobody cares about the exact time of day a release
happens, so I'm now setting it to a slightly arbitrary time early in the morning.
