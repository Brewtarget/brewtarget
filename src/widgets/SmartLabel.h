 * \class SmartLabel
 *
 * \brief Performs the necessary magic to select display units for any label.  Specifically, this allows the user to
 *        right-click on the label for a field and select
 *           (a) which unit system to use for that field (eg US Customary (mass), Imperial (mass) or Metric/SI (mass)
 *               for a weight field) - all done via \c Measurement::SystemOfMeasurement
 *           (b) which units within that system to use for the field (eg kg, g, mg if the user has selected Metric/SI on
 *               a weight field) - all done via \c Measurement::UnitSystem::RelativeScale.
 *        Moreover, the settings for each label‡ are remembered (via \c PersistentSettings) for future times the program
 *        is run.
 *
 *        This has been a rather hidden feature of the program as there were no visual clues that right-clicking on a
 *        field label would bring up a useful menu (and it is not common behaviour in other software).  Where possible,
 *        we have now made it so that
 *          • mouseover on the label underlines the label text (hopefully making the user think of a clickable link),
 *          • where left-clicking would otherwise have no effect, it now has the same effect as right-click.
 *
 *        A \c SmartLabel will usually, but not always, have a corresponding \c SmartField.  (HOWEVER, per the notes
 *        below, there are some cases where there is \b no corresponding \c SmartField and some cases where there is
 *        more than one corresponding \c SmartField.)  These \c SmartLabel and the \c SmartField (or one of them
 *        if there is more than one) will be Qt buddies, which mostly just means that the \c SmartField accepts the
 *        input focus on behalf of the \c SmartLabel when the user types the label's shortcut key combination.  (TBD: It
 *        also means we don't have to store a bunch of info in this object that we can just get from our buddy.  Eg
 *        \c BtFieldType is stored in \c SmartField, so we don't also need to store it here in \c SmartLabel.)
 *
 *        When the \c SmartLabel needs to tell the \c SmartField and/or other widgets (eg a range slider) that the
 *        \c UnitSystem etc has changed, it sends a \c changedUnitSystemOrScale signal.   (Previously this signal was
 *        called \c labelChanged.)
 *
 *        NOTE: There are some circumstances where a \c SmartLabel is associated with more than one \c SmartField.
 *              Typically this is where we have a min/max range (eg on a \c Style record in \c StyleEditor).  The
 *              underlying \c QLabel can only have a single "buddy", which is the last one passed in via
 *              \c QLabel::setBuddy (typically done via the property system from code generated from a .ui file).
 *              HOWEVER by calling \c SmartLabel::addBuddy instead, then all buddies can be remembered by \c SmartLabel
 *              (even though the base \c QLabel will only retain the last set one).  This means a change to forced
 *              \c SystemOfMeasurement or \c RelativeScale on the \c SmartLabel will be correctly remembered (via
 *              \c PersistentSettings) and applied to the multiple \c SmartField objects.
 *                 IN PRACTICE, you don't need to worry about this, provided you call \c SMART_FIELD_INIT (or
 *              similar) for each \c SmartField, everything will be handled correctly.
 *
 *        NOTE: There are also cases where a \c SmartLabel has no buddy.  Eg, in \c MainWindow, we have a number of
 *              sliders that show predicted gravity for the \c Recipe along with the gravity range for the \c Style.
 *
 *        NOTE: There is another set of edge cases where we have a \c SmartField that does not have a \c SmartLabel
 *              (just a \c QLabel).  This is either because there is no scale or unit system to change (eg because the
 *              field is a \c NonPhysicalQuantity such as \c NonPhysicalQuantity::Percentage) or, because the field is
 *              being used in a conversion tool where we want the GUI to accept/show only one type of units, but we
 *              still want to leverage all the magical conversion that \c SmartField knows how to do.
 *
 *        NOTE: Finally (I hope!) there is the case of \c BtTableModel subclasses.  In such table models, some of the
 *              columns will have user-selectable \c SystemOfMeasurement and/or \c RelativeScale.  In this case, the
 *              \c BtTableModel::ColumnInfo mini-class "owns" the settings.
 *
 *        ‡ Previously, we stored the settings not "per \c SmartLabel" but "per \c SmartField".  This is logical for
 *          the mainline case of (the \c SmartLabel has one \c SmartField).  However, it makes things a bit
 *          complicated for the two edge cases: (a) the \c SmartLabel has more than one \c SmartField and (b) the
 *          \c SmartLabel has more than no \c SmartField
 *
 *
 * This is extra work when
 *          a \c SmartLabel has two \c SmartField buddies, and creates the need for \c SmartLabel::addBuddy etc
 *          above.  In some ways it would be simpler to use the name of the \c SmartLabel as the lookup key in
 *          \c PersistentSettings.  For the moment, we do not as it would require extra complexity elsewhere.  Eg, the
 *          \c SmartLabel does not currently know its name, so we'd need to inject it via an additional parameter on
 *          \c SmartField::init and some more work in the \c SMART_FIELD_INIT and related macros.
