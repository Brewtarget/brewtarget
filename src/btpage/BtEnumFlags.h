    * @brief These flags are used for placing objects on BtPage either relational to
    * other objects or to the page it self.
    * I use the bitshift method below as it more clearly shows the order of the flags and easier to see if one was missed. :)
    *
    * As these flags will be used with the | operator we can never have overlapping bits in their values
    * i.e. (1<<1) to give me an integer value of 2.
    * bitmasks and actual values are commented below on each value.
