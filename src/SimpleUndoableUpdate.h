 * \brief Each instance of this class is an undoable update to a 'simple' editable field of a recipe, style, etc.
 *        By simple, we mean that there is one of them and that it is non-relational (ie can be passed and set by value).
 *        The thing being updated needs to inherit from Q_OBJECT and the field being changed needs to have been
 *        declared as a Q_PROPERTY.
