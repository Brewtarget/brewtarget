 * \brief Item needed to implement folders in the trees
 *
 * This provides a generic item from which the trees are built. Since most of
 * the actions required are the same regardless of the item being stored (e.g.
 * hop or equipment), this class considers them all the same. 
 *
 * A few notes, just so I don't have to rethink all of this. This class
 * generates NO signals. It catches signals from cahnges made in the database,
 * but I currently don't think it needs to signal anything itself. I reserve
 * the right to chnage this just as soon as I actually start working the
 * trees.
