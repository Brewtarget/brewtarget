# Description is done in a different way, perhaps because it's a multi-line field
%description
@CONFIG_APPLICATION_NAME_UC@ is a calculator for brewing beer. It is a Qt-based program which
allows you to create recipes from a database of ingredients. It calculates
all the important parameters, helps you with mash temperatures, and just
makes the process of recipe formulation much easier.

# The files in the package
# These are specified by where they will be installed, hence the absolute paths but we can use glob patterns based on
# what's in the build tree

# Change log is a required section
# By default, you are expected to have the full change log right here in this spec file.  (I think there might be a way
# to pull in the change log data from a separate file, but I didn't yet figure it out.)  So, for now at least, we get
# the `bt` build tool script to append the changelog data after this file is processed.
#
# *** NB: THIS MEANS %changelog MUST BE THE LAST ENTRY IN THE FILE.  DO NOT ADD ANY LINES AFTER IT. ***
