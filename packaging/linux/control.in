# See comments in meson.build for how this file gets processed into mbuild/control.  Then see comments in the build tool
# script (bt) for how we strip out comments, join "folded" lines and output to
# mbuild/packaging/linux/[projectName]-[versionNumber]_amd64/DEBIAN/control.
#
# See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html the format of a Debian package control file
#
# NB: The lack of blank lines below is deliberate!   A control file consists of one or more "stanzas" of fields.  The
# stanzas are separated by empty lines.  Some control files allow only one stanza; others allow several (eg one for a
# source package and another for the binary packages generated from that source).  To keep things simple, we only ship
# the binaries in the deb package, because the source code is easily available by other routes.  So we only want one
# stanza.  So, no blank lines.  (I'm very much hoping that comments are OK inside a stanza.)
#
# See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#binary-package-control-files-debian-control for the
# fields in the stanza of a binary package control file.
#
#
# Package (Mandatory) : name of the binary package
#    Package names (both source and binary) must consist only of lower case letters (a-z), digits (0-9), plus (+) and
#    minus (-) signs, and periods (.). They must be at least two characters long and must start with an alphanumeric
#    character.
#
Package: @CONFIG_APPLICATION_NAME_LC@
#
# Source (Optional) : source package name
#    We don't specify this as we don't ship the source as a deb package
#
# Version (Mandatory) : version number of a package. The format is: [epoch:]upstream_version[-debian_revision].
#
Version: @CONFIG_VERSION_STRING@-1
#
# Section (Recommended) : application area into which the package has been classified
#    See https://packages.debian.org/unstable/ for a list of all the sections.  TLDR is that misc is the closest fit for
#    us.
#
Section: misc
#
# Priority (Recommended) : Represents how important it is that the user have the package installed
#    Since not all Linux users brew beer, optional seems pretty reasonable here, especially as it is "the default
#    priority for the majority of the [Debian] archive"
#
Priority: optional
#
# Architecture (Mandatory) : in this context it's "a unique single word identifying a Debian machine architecture"
#    Fortunately we don't have to worry about catering to every possibility (which you can see eg by running
#    `dpkg-architecture -L` on the command line on Ubuntu.
#
Architecture: amd64
#
# Essential (Optional) : We don't need this.  It's only for packages that aren't supposed to be removeable
#
# Depends, Recommends, Suggests, Enhances, Pre-Depends : Dependencies on, conflicts with, other packages
#    If we were doing everything the true Debian way, including shipping a source package and its makefile (yikes!) then
#    there are various tools such as `dh_makeshlibs` and `dh_shlibdeps` that help us generate the right dependencies.
#    All we would have to put here is 'Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}' or some such.  However, if we only want to ship a
#    binary and not maintain a separate build with its own makefile for the source code, then those tools won't help and
#    we need to maintain things manually here.  Fortunately our list of dependencies is not horrendous.
#
#    Note that you can see the version of a package libfoobar by running the following command from the shell:
#       apt-cache show foobar | grep Version
#
#    Note too that we need either libqt5gui5 or libqt5gui5-gles, not both (which is not possible as they conflict).
#
#    Normally, this field is (surprisingly) not allowed to be "folded" (ie split across multiple lines).  However, we do
#    our own folding in the bt build script, so the backslash line continuations are OK here!
#
#    I _think_ libqt5core5a has been replaced by libqt5core5t64

# Installed-Size (Optional) : an estimate of the total amount of disk space required to install the named package
#    The disk space is given as the integer value of the estimated installed size in bytes, divided by 1024 and rounded
#    up.  .:TODO:. At some point we should implement this, ideally by having the build system calculate the value
#
#Installed-Size: 17758
#
# Maintainer (Mandatory) : The package maintainer’s name and email address.
#    The name must come first, then the email address inside angle brackets <> (in RFC822 format).  If the maintainer’s
#    name contains a full stop then the whole field will not work directly as an email address due to a misfeature in
#    the syntax specified in RFC822; a program using this field as an address must check for this and correct the
#    problem if necessary (for example by putting the name in round brackets and moving it to the end, and bringing the
#    email address forward).
#
Maintainer: @CONFIG_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER@
#
# Description (Mandatory) : a description of the binary package, consisting of two parts, the synopsis or the short
# description, and the long description
#
Description: GUI beer brewing software
 @CONFIG_APPLICATION_NAME_UC@ is a calculator for brewing beer. It is a Qt-based program which
 allows you to create recipes from a database of ingredients. It calculates
 all the important parameters, helps you with mash temperatures, and just
 makes the process of recipe formulation much easier.
