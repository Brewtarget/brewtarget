  General Notes:

  It is not possible to validate a BeerXML 1.0 document solely with an XSD file, for reasons that are explained in the
  Brewtarget C++ source code.  Nevertheless, this file goes some considerable way to doing such validation.

  Although they are generally helpful examples, there are some obvious errors in the BeerXML sample files downloadable
  from www.beerxml.com:
  • Everywhere the <CARB_MAX>...</CARB_MAX> tag is used (eg lines 268, 605, 977, 1278 of recipes.xml and on multiple
    lines of style.xml) the value has a spurious '>', eg:
       "<CARB_MAX>2.4></CARB_MAX>" = actual
       "<CARB_MAX>2.4</CARB_MAX>"  = correct
    This will (correctly) generate an "invalid character encountered" error when parsed against this schema document.

  elementFormDefault="qualified" just means we have to specify the namespace of all the tags in this schema document,
  which keeps them out of the default (unnamed) namespace of the XML documents we'll be parsing
-->
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
           elementFormDefault="qualified">

   <!-- Definitions of complex types : START -->

   <!-- As a general rule, for its core "amount" fields, BeerXML 1.0 prescribes a unit of measurement (eg minutes,
        percent, kilograms, liters, etc) and stores the number (eg <BOIL_TIME>60.0<BOIL_TIME> means boil time of 60
        minutes.  We could leave all the numeric core fields as decimals and integers, but defining types for them
        gives some additional sanity checking (eg durations cannot be negative) and makes the field specifications a
        bit more readable (because the name of the field usually does not specify the units it must be measured in).

        Note, however, that different rules apply for "extension fields", which must be treated as text, even when the
        "Format" is marked as something else.  This is because the BeerXML 1.0 Standard says extension fields are "not
        required ... to be supported by a particular program.  Where implemented, these tags provide a consistent
        method for display only.  None of these values should be used for import as the display value may be rounded
        from the true value. ... All standards of the original BeerXML description also apply [to these fields] with
        the exception of units: all fields that are defined for display only may also use a unit tag after them.  For
        example '3.45 gal' is an acceptable value."  (This is even the case for some fields where you would think there
        is only one possible unit of measurement.  Eg "<EST_ABV>5.3 %</EST_ABV>" is valid because it is an "extension
        field" but <ABV_MIN>...</ABV_MIN> can only contain a decimal number becuase it is a core field.)
   -->

   <!-- In the world of XSD, any field defined simply as xs:string is allowed to be empty (ie "") or to contain only
        blanks (tabs, spaces, etc).  Whilst neither of these cases is explicitly prohibited in the BeerXML 1.0
        Standard, there are some cases where both are clearly unhelpful.  Eg, whilst it is almost certainly fine for
        the "required" fields BREWER to be blank, it is hard to justify having a blank NAME field in a RECIPE or a HOP
        for example.

        All that said, we try to use this stronger requirement sparingly, as there are cases that are open to
        interpretation, eg should NAME be required to be non-blank for MASH and for MASH_STEP?  And, even if not, if we
        are, say, trying to import a RECIPE that has a blank NAME in one or more of its MASH_STEPs, could we generate a
        suitable name on the fly and allow the import to succeed?

        "Programs shall endeavor to store as many significant digits as possible to avoid truncating or losing small
        values".  I think we can usually use xs:decimal rather than xs:double (or xs:float) for fields marked "floating
        point number" in the standard, but this is something we may need to revisit.

        ************************************************************************************************
        * Now begins the real substance.  *** In the following, pay attention to singular vs plural. ***
        ************************************************************************************************

   At heart, a BeerXML consists of lists of HOPS, FERMENTABLES, YEASTS, MISCS, WATERS, STYLES, MASHS [sic], RECIPES and
   EQUIPMENTS.  (In the standard these lists are called "record sets".)  In each case, the structure is similar, eg
   <HOPS>...</HOPS> contains (depending on which bit of the standard you're looking at) either "one or more" or "zero
   or more" HOP records, each of which is <HOP>...</HOP> with various required and optional fields (which unfortunately
   are allowed to be in any order, something that makes validation harder than it otherwise would be for, IMHO, very
   little benefit).

   These lists can occur in multiple places.  Eg, inside each <RECIPE>...</RECIPE> is a list of "zero or more" hops (ie
   a <HOPS>...</HOPS> record containing zero or more <HOP>...</HOP> records.  But <HOPS>...</HOPS> is also a valid top-
   level record in its own right, where it must contain "one or more Hop records".  It's annoying that the standard is
   (needlessly) inconsistent in whether the minimum number of contained records is zero or one, but there is a way to
   deal with it.

   Our approach is that, for each of the base types, we first define a type for the individual record.  Eg HopType is
   used for <HOP>...</HOP> records.  We then easily define two further types, one for a list of "one or more" of
   these records, and another for the case where a list is allowed to conntain "zero or more" records.  Eg
   HopsType is used for a <HOPS>...</HOPS> record that contains one or more <HOP>...</HOP> records, and
   HopsEmptyAllowedType is used for a <HOPS>...</HOPS> record that my be empty but otherwise one or more
   <HOP>...</HOP> records.

   Note that not every type of "record set" needs an "EmptyAllowed" version of its type.  We only define types we're
   going to use elsewhere.

   <!-- Finally, there's one more trick we need to pull.  The BeerXML 1.0 Standard says a BeerXML document consists, at
        its top level, of one or more of the following "record sets":
           <HOPS>...</HOPS>
           <FERMENTABLES>...</FERMENTABLES>
           <YEASTS>...</YEASTS>
           <MISCS>...</MISCS>
           <WATERS>...</WATERS>
           <STYLES>...</STYLES>
           <MASHS>...</MASHS>
           <RECIPES>...</RECIPES>
           <EQUIPMENTS>...</EQUIPMENTS>
        This would be relatively easy to represent here _IF_ such "record sets" were inside another tag.  But they are
        not.  What to do?  Well, to the accompanying sound of Vincent Price saying "Bwahahaha", we simply solve the
        problem in the C++ code by inserting a root node in the document before parsing it against this XSD.

        Specifically, we load the BeerXML 1.0 document we want to process into memory, then edit that in-memory copy on
        the fly to add our <BEER_XML>...</BEER_XML> tag around the contents, then parse that amended copy of the
        document against this XSD.

        So, to be clear, you should not expect to see <BEER_XML>...</BEER_XML> tags in a BeerXML 1.0 file (whether it's
        one we created or one originating elsewhere).  It is just something that we pretend is present (by adding it to
        our in-memory copy of a document we are parsing) to make this part of the XSD at least an order of magnitude
        simpler than it would otherwise be.
